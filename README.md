The image processing is performed using OpenCV.
The image classification is performed using a PyTorch Model.
The backend of the website uses Flask.
The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

1. This project takes an image of an insect and classifies it using a PyTorch Model. 

2. I chose to link a frontend framework (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a Flask backend. I also based my frontend on viewport width, so it is responsive to mobile dimensions. I have API calls in order to process the multipart HTTP post requests for image transfer and return predictions. In addition, I save the images uploaded to the website to Google Cloud Storage.
